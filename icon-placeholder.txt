PLACEHOLDER ICON FILE
=====================

This is a placeholder for icon.png

To complete the PWA setup:
1. Replace this file with your actual icon.png (192x192 and 512x512 pixels)
2. The icon should be a PNG file named "icon.png"
3. Place it in the root directory of your project

Your icon should represent your kiosk system and work well at both small (192x192) and large (512x512) sizes.
